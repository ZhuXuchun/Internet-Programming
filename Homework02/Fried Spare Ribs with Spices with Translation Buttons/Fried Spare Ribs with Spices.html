            <h3>1.Cut the pork into small pieces of about 5 cm, set aside and let stand.</h3>

            <h3>2.Chop the ginger and garlic and mix them together.</h3>
                <img src="Pictures%20Of%20Fried%20Spare%20Ribs%20with%20Spices/Chop%20The%20Garlic%20And%20The%20Ginger.jpg" alt="Chop The Garlic And The Ginger" width="600" height="500">
            <h3>3.Put the cut meat into the container, add the chopped ginger and garlic, introduce the cooking wine, marinate for 1 hour to let the flavor of the seasoning enter the meat, which is convenient for the frying step later.</h3>

            <h3>4.Shred the bell pepper and set aside.</h3>

            <h3>5.Beat three eggs, mix the egg white and egg liquid evenly to make it sticky.</h3>

            <h3>7.This is a very critical step. You need to put the marinated meat strips in the egg liquid for sizing, then take them out, put them in the prepared dry flour, and coat the outer skin with a layer of flour. It is better not to feel sticky to the hand. If the breaded flour is not thick enough, the outer skin will fall off during the subsequent frying step, resulting in no crispy taste at the end.</h3>

            <h3>8.Next, proceed to the frying part. After the pot is preheated, you need to put a lot of cooking oil into the pot (you need to be able to submerge all the meat strips), and add the processed meat strips one by one when the oil temperature reaches 70% hot (in order to prevent the flour from turning the meat strips stick together)</h3>

            <h3>9.When the meat strips are deep-fried until the surface is golden, take them out of the pan and let stand to drain the oil, and set aside</h3>

            <h3>10.After the fried meat strips stand for 20 minutes, add a little oil in another hot pan, add garlic, chili, and sweet peppers, stir fry for a minute, then add the fried meat strips, and then stir fry together for about one more time minute. Before serving, sprinkle with salt and pepper according to your own taste and serve.</h3>
